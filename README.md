This is the first version of a daily news quiz for Baltimore area news consumers. It generates 10 increasingly difficult questions, with rising point levels from 10 to 30, with an 11th bonus question worth 50 points.
Each day the quiz will generate a new set of questions, which the Admin will review and make live.
Players can store their player names and see how their cumulative score stacks up.
It is based on a Gemini API key that scrapes from the news sites provided by the Admin.
It is built on code written by Claude AI.
It calls back to file repositories stored in GitHub.
